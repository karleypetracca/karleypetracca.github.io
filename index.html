        <h2>What's this all about?</h2>
        <p>I've had an amazing career journey for over 6 years in business
        strategy and data in Atlanta. But something I've come to learn about
        myself recently is that it never felt like the right fit for my
        skillset and that there was something else out there to explore.</p>
        <p>So I'm finally taking the plunge and following my passion into software
        development.</p>

        <h2>Why software development?</h2>
        <p>When I think back on the years, its easy to see how the signs were there all along pointing to software development:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>My teenage days were spent using HTML to build the perfect
          MySpace page.</li>
          <li>Digital art has been a hobby since childhood, forcing me to
          learn about creative design as well as positioning / placement /
          margins / etc for online display.</li>
          <li>I was the "oddball" in school (and later the office!) who
          enjoyed creating complicated formulas in excel and other similar
          programs.</li>
          <li>Data analysis was something I gravitated to in my career and
          greatly enjoyed learning Tableau, Python, R and SQL to stay
          competitive.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="endingNote">I have an official portfolio in the works but
        until its release, <em>please
        check my <a href="https://github.com/karleypetracca">GitHub</a> for past and current projects</em>.  I am adding new repos
        every week!</h2>
