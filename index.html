    <h2>What's this all about?</h2>
    <h3>
      <p>I've had an amazing career journey for over 6 years in business strategy and data in Atlanta. But something I've come to learn about myself recently is that it never felt like the right fit for my skillset and that there was something else out there to explore.</p>
      <p>So I'm finally taking the plunge and following my passion into web development.</p>
    </h3>

    <h2>Why web development?</h2>
    <h3>
      <p>When I think back on the years, its easy to see how the signs were there all along pointing to web development:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>My teenage days were spent using HTML to build the perfect MySpace page.</li>
        <li>Digital art has been a hobby since childhood, forcing me to learn about creative design as well as positioning / placement / margins / etc for online display.</li>
        <li>I was the "oddball" in school (and later work!) who enjoyed creating complicated formulas in excel and other similar programs.</li>
        <li>Data analysis was something I gravitated to in my career and greatly enjoyed learning Tableau, Python, R and SQL to stay competitive.</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
    </h3>
